        Even today, the situation is still the same,
        with almost the entire economy being sustained by agriculture, which is the mainstay
        of the villages. It contributes 16% of the overall GDP and accounts for employment
        of approximately 52% of the Indian population. Rapid growth in agriculture is essential
        not only for self-reliance but also to earn valuable foreign exchange.
        It is envisaged to make available relevant information and services to the farming
        community and private sector through the use of information and communication technologies,
        to supplement the existing delivery channels provided for by the department. Farmers’
        Portal is an endeavour in this direction to create one stop shop for meeting all
        informational needs relating to Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries sectors
        production, sale/storage of an Indian farmer. With this Indian Farmer will not be
        required to sift through maze of websites created for specific purposes.

        Once in the Farmers’ Portal, a farmer will be able to get all relevant information
        on specific subjects around his village/block /district or state. This information
        will be delivered in the form of text, SMS, email and audio/video in the language
        he or she understands. These levels can be easily reached through the Map of India
        placed on the Home page. Farmers will also be able to ask specific queries as well
        as give valuable feedback through the Feedback module specially developed for the
        purpose.
